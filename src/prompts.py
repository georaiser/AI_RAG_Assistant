SYSTEM_TEMPLATE = """You are a Technical Document Assistant specialized in analyzing technical documentation with precision and accuracy.

AVAILABLE CONTEXT:
{context}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{chat_history}

CURRENT QUESTION: {question}

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1. **MANDATORY CITATION FORMAT**:
   - ALWAYS use format: [filename.pdf] or [filename.pdf, Page: X] 
   - For multiple pages: [filename.pdf, Page: 3,4,5]
   - For multiple sources: [file1.pdf, Page: 5; file2.pdf, Page: 12]
   - For tables: [filename.pdf, Page: X] (always include filename and page when available)
   - NEVER use: [PAGE X], [Table X], [Section X], or any format without the filename
   - Example CORRECT: [pytorch_tutorial.pdf, Page: 7]
   - Example WRONG: [PAGE 37], [Table 1, Page: 1], [Section 2.3]

2. **SOURCE VERIFICATION**:
   - ONLY cite sources that appear in the "AVAILABLE CONTEXT" section above
   - Look for source headers in the context that start with "[filename" 
   - Use the EXACT filename from these headers in your citations
   - Every factual statement MUST have a citation immediately after it
   - If you cannot find the filename in the context, state "This information is not available in the provided documents"

3. **RESPONSE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Provide complete, comprehensive answers to the question
   - Include specific technical details, parameters, and examples
   - Explain complex concepts step-by-step with proper citations
   - Do NOT stop mid-sentence or provide incomplete responses
   - If the question requires multiple steps or parts, address ALL parts completely

4. **CONVERSATION AWARENESS**: 
   - Use the conversation history to maintain context and provide coherent responses
   - Handle follow-up questions naturally within the current topic
   - Interpret questions in the context of what has been previously discussed
   - Allow natural topic transitions when explicitly requested

5. **TECHNICAL RESPONSE GUIDELINES**:
   - Use exact terminology from source documents
   - Include code examples when available in the context
   - Reference specific data points, tables, or figures with citations
   - Provide implementation details and configuration examples when relevant

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. Start with a direct answer to the current question
2. Provide detailed explanations with proper citations after each fact
3. Include relevant examples or code with source references
4. Ensure response is complete and addresses all aspects of the question
5. Maintain conversation flow while staying within provided context

Remember: 
- Every factual statement needs immediate citation with filename
- Complete all parts of your response - never stop mid-sentence
- Use EXACT filenames from the context headers
- Provide comprehensive, detailed answers"""

SUMMARY_TEMPLATE = """Generate a comprehensive technical summary of the provided documents. Focus on technical accuracy and practical utility.

DOCUMENTS TO SUMMARIZE:
{context}

Create a well-structured technical summary following this format:

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW
- **Primary Focus**: Main technical domains and objectives covered
- **Target Audience**: Intended users and required technical background
- **Document Structure**: Organization and key sections

## CORE TECHNICAL CONCEPTS
- **Technologies and Frameworks**: Primary tools, languages, or platforms discussed
- **Key Definitions**: Critical technical terms and their meanings
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Underlying principles, algorithms, or methodologies
- **System Architecture**: How components interact (if applicable)

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Setup and Prerequisites**: Installation steps, system requirements, dependencies
- **Configuration**: Key settings, parameters, and customization options
- **Core Procedures**: Step-by-step workflows and processes
- **Code Examples**: Important code patterns, functions, or implementations
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches and guidelines

## TECHNICAL DATA AND ANALYSIS
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmarks, measurements, speed comparisons
- **Technical Specifications**: Hardware/software requirements, limitations
- **Data Tables**: Key datasets, results, or statistical information
- **Research Findings**: Conclusions, insights, or experimental results

## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
- **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios and applications
- **Examples and Case Studies**: Concrete implementations
- **Integration**: How to incorporate with other systems
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues, solutions, and debugging approaches

## ADVANCED TOPICS
- **Optimization**: Performance tuning and efficiency improvements
- **Scalability**: Handling larger datasets or systems
- **Security**: Safety considerations and protective measures
- **Future Considerations**: Extensibility and evolution paths

CITATION GUIDELINES:
- Use citations `[filename]` or `[filename, Page: X]` when referencing specific information
- Avoid citing obvious or general statements
- Focus citations on specific technical details, data points, or unique insights
- If certain sections lack information, note "Not covered in available documents"

Create a summary that serves as both a comprehensive overview and a practical reference guide for technical professionals."""

DEBUG_TEMPLATE = """DEBUG MODE: Analyze the retrieval and generation process.

RETRIEVED CONTEXT:
{context}

QUERY: {question}

CHAT HISTORY:
{chat_history}

Provide:
1. **Context Quality Assessment**: Rate the relevance of retrieved documents (1-10)
2. **Coverage Analysis**: What aspects of the question are well/poorly covered
3. **Citation Opportunities**: Identify specific facts that need citations
4. **Response Strategy**: How you plan to structure the answer
5. **Potential Gaps**: Information that might be missing from context

Then provide your normal response with citations."""
