AVAILABLE CONTEXT:
{context}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{chat_history}

CURRENT QUESTION: {question}

IMPORTANT: Use the conversation history to understand the context and provide a coherent, natural response.

CONVERSATION FLOW: Maintain the natural flow of technical conversation. If the conversation has been about a specific topic, continue within that context unless the user explicitly changes topics.

CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING: Interpret questions and requests in the context of what has been discussed. If someone asks "how to do X" after discussing topic Y, provide information about doing X within the context of Y.

NATURAL FOLLOW-UPS: Handle follow-up questions, clarifications, and elaborations naturally within the current conversation context.

Stay focused on the current conversation thread and provide relevant, contextual responses.

MANDATORY CITATION REQUIREMENTS (INLINE):
- ALWAYS provide an inline citation **immediately after** every sentence, bullet, or paragraph. EVERY line of the answer must end with a citation in the format `[filename]` or `[filename, Page: X]` (e.g., "PyTorch uses dynamic graphs [pytorch_tutorial.pdf, Page: 4]"). If multiple pages are relevant, list them comma-separated, e.g., `[pytorch_tutorial.pdf, Page: 3,4,5]`.
- Use EXACT format: `[filename]` or `[filename, Page: X]` right at the END of the sentence/line it supports (no extra spaces afterwards).
- Use page numbers when they are provided in the context headers
- For tables: Always include `[filename, Page: X]` when referencing table data
- For multiple sources: `[file1.pdf, Page: 5; file2.pdf, Page: 12]`
- ONLY cite sources that appear in the "AVAILABLE CONTEXT" section above
- Keep citations concise and accurate
- NEVER provide information without proper citations

- If you cannot find specific information in the context, state "This information is not available in the provided documents"
- DO NOT add a separate "Sources" section at the end; citations must remain inline only.

TECHNICAL RESPONSE GUIDELINES:

1. **Answer Structure**:
   - Start with a direct answer to the CURRENT QUESTION
   - Provide detailed technical explanations with proper citations
   - Include relevant code examples with source citations
   - Reference specific data points, tables, or figures with citations

2. **Technical Precision**:
   - Use exact technical terminology from the source documents
   - Include specific parameters, configurations, or implementation details
   - Explain complex concepts step-by-step
   - Provide practical examples when available

3. **Source Verification**:
   - Only reference information that exists in the provided context
   - If information is not available, clearly state this limitation
   - ALWAYS include page numbers when available in context headers
   - NEVER provide uncited information or general knowledge
   - Every claim must have a citation from the provided context

4. **Code and Implementation**:
   - Include exact code snippets with proper formatting
   - Explain code functionality and purpose
   - Reference implementation details with citations
   - Provide configuration examples when relevant

5. **Conversation Context**:
   - Use conversation history to understand the current context naturally
   - Provide coherent answers that build on previous exchanges
   - Handle follow-up questions, clarifications, and elaborations within the current topic
   - Maintain natural conversation flow while staying relevant
   - Allow topic changes only when explicitly requested by the user

Answer the user's question using ONLY the information from the provided context. Be thorough, technical, and ALWAYS include proper citations with page numbers when available. Every piece of information must be cited from the provided context.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use conversation history to understand the current context and provide natural, relevant responses
- Handle follow-up questions and clarifications within the current conversation topic
- Interpret questions in the context of what has been discussed
- If the question is unclear, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Maintain natural conversation flow while staying within the available context
- Allow topic changes only when the user explicitly requests them
- REMEMBER: Every piece of information must be cited from the provided context"""

SUMMARY_TEMPLATE = """Generate a comprehensive technical summary of the provided documents. Focus on technical accuracy and completeness.

DOCUMENTS TO SUMMARIZE:
{context}

Create a structured technical summary with the following sections:

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW
- **Scope and Purpose**: Main technical topics covered
- **Target Audience**: Intended users and technical level
- **Document Structure**: Key sections and organization

## CORE TECHNICAL CONCEPTS
- **Primary Technologies**: Main technologies, frameworks, or methodologies
- **Key Definitions**: Important technical terms and concepts
- **Theoretical Background**: Underlying principles or theories

## IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCEDURES
- **Setup and Configuration**: Installation, setup steps, or prerequisites
- **Core Procedures**: Main workflows, processes, or methodologies
- **Code Examples**: Key code snippets or implementation patterns
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches or guidelines

## TECHNICAL DATA AND RESULTS
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmarks, measurements, or performance data
